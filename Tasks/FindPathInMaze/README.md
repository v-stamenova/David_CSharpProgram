## Find path in maze

This console programm allows the user to insert the length of a maze, its elements ('-' for blank space, '*' for walls), starting point and ending point. When a step is taken, a '#' symbol replaces the blank space. In the end the programm returns all possible routes to the point.

May add a maze generating method in the future.
